##  <p align="center"> Video and Interaction Relay Associated Tool </p>
**A website which serves as a socializing platform providing chat, group creation, synced streaming with a user-friendly interface.**
- Nowadays, Billions of people around the world use social media to share information and make connections.
- On a personal level, social media allows you to communicate with friends and family, learn new things, develop your interests, and be entertained.
- We provide a robust platform, ‘VIRAT’, with a user- friendly interface that enables us to create groups, chat with friends, watch local videos in sync with friends by creating rooms with admin access.

## Working:
- A user first encounters a log in page where he/she is asked to enter already registered credentials such as email and password.
- If incorrect credentials are entered, your login form will be rejected. If account doesn’t exist, he/she will be redirected to sign-up page to create account.
- After successful log-in, he/she will land to dashboard which contains general profile settings, chatting options and a watch-party button
- WatchParty onclick directs to a video streaming player with robust video-audio calling facility and side by side chatting option.
- A log-out option is also provided to logout safely.
